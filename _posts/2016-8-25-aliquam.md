Machine Learning X Automated Face Analysis 2015

Inspired by Professor Jeff Cohn's automated face analysis, i tried automated face analysis on a class project.

Dataset is retrieved from UC-Ivrine Machine Learning Repository.

Applying PCA with kernel estimates, i managed to narrow down key factors to corrugators and zygomaticus to determine clusters.

Compared among spectral clustering, kernal PCA, svm, Kernel svm and K-means, I trained a model that can predict nine grammatical facial expressions with 86% accuracy.

In the future, i hope to gather more general public data on specific facial expressions and gestures, such as smiles. I hope to verify existing theories on emotion categorizations and even have some discoveries.
