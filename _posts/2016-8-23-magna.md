This study looks for the effect of gesture production under stress on extraversion and neuroticism. I also discovered cultural differences in gesture production.

Based on Hostetter, A.B. & Potthoff, A.L.(2012), i recruited several pairs of undergraduate students to conduct word pair task. 

Participants were asked to perform a word pair study. One to describe the word without actually saying the word. The other guessed the word. 10 seconds time limit was set for each word.

Results indicated that under pressure, people with high extraversion or high neuroticism produced more gestures.Their sizes of gesutres are also larger. In addition, people from Asian produce less gestures than people in western culture.

In the future, i hope to use gesture recognition technology to deep investigate gesture size. So far, there is not many or none comprehensive system to measure gesture patterns and size. I hope to create such systems.

Moreover, cultural differences is not ignorable. Knowing that different cultures share different conventional gestures, i hope to compare gesture production in different cultures more precisely in the future.
