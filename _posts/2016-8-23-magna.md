This study looks for the effect of gesture production under stress on extraversion and neuroticism. I also discovered cultural differences in gesture production.

Based on Hostetter, A.B. & Potthoff, A.L.(2012), i recruited several pairs of undergraduate students to conduct word pair task. 

Results indicated that people with high extraversion or high neuroticism produced more gestures. Also, people from Asian produce less gestures than people in western culture.
