This is a project proposal for the World Expo 2010 in Shanghai, China. This proposal received National First Prize on Youth Innovation and Science Competition and got published on Youth Science and Technology Newspaper in 2010.

Most people in China live in apartments within communities due to large population. One of the issues from living in community is noise and unexpected sounds. People are usually unaware of effects from their own behaviors. Complaints about such matters cost police resources.

I proposed a project of mobile service robots that can provide roadside service, and more importantly, provide sound regulation.

During the day, the robots can serve as information guide for pedestrains and tourists. The robots is solar-powered so we don't have to worry about battery issue. In case the robots crash or break down, they will send out location message to control center at the last minute.

After business hour, the robots will switch to patrol mode, which will patrol around certain area to detect noise production. With three robots patrolling in one area, trilateration algorithm can be applied to track to location of the noise.

I proposed that connecting with each household's network, we can set up a alert system to remind citizens of reducing noise.
