This is a project proposal for the World Expo 2010 in Shanghai, China. This proposal received National First Prize on Youth Innovation and Science Competition and got published on Youth Science and Technology Newspaper in 2010.

Most people in China live in apartments within communities due to large population. One of the issues from living in community is noise and unexpected sounds. People are usually unaware of effects from their own behaviors. Complaints about such matters cost police resources.

I proposed a project of mobile service robots that can provide roadside service, and more importantly, provide sound regulation.
