		          </header>
		          <p>This project focus on user experience and collaborative outcomes on automatic eye-gaze alignment for Double Robots. We created a interface that could track users' eye gaze and rotate the robot automatically. We are interested in whether this will improve cooperative outcomes or increase team affliation.<br/> Our goal of this study was to know the use of automatic implementation could improve remote cooperativeness. </p>

					<h3>What does the robot look like</h3>
				</header>
				<p>On top of the oringinal Double Robots, three cameras capturing at the same time allow real time trasmission and coverage of 360 degree of view.<br/> A campass app was created to control the degree of the rotation. </p>

					<h3>How does this work</h3>
				</header>
				<p>With the eyetracker, the audience is free from keyboard. Receiving images from three cameras, we create interface with interactive high and low resolution sceen. This allow user to keep track of location.<br/> A partial ellipse on top of the screen was added to show the direction of the robot. It always corresponds to the high resolution screen.</p>
